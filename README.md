# Node.js URL Shortener with Visit Tracker

This repository contains a URL shortener service built with Node.js and EJS. It allows users to enter a long URL which is then shortened using a randomly generated `shortid`. The service also keeps track of how many times each shortened URL is visited, providing insights into the popularity of the linked sites.

## Features

- **URL Shortening:** Converts long URLs into manageable short links with unique identifiers.
- **Visit Tracking:** Monitors and records the number of visits to each shortened URL.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Utilizes MongoDB to store and manage URL mappings and visit counts.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** For server-side logic and handling HTTP requests.
- **EJS:** As a templating engine to render dynamic HTML pages.
- **MongoDB:** As a NoSQL database to store URL and tracking data.
